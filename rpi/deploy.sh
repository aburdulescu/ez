# compile

# generate files
# start tracker
# add files
# start seeders

# OR

# create a folder for each seeder which contains everything(ezl+config, ezs+config)
# copy this folder to the target
# generate the files there? no, because then the seeders will have different files
# then generate them in one place and copy(maybe using ez!) them where needed and if needed
